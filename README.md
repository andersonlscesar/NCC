# NCC - No Culture Cancel 


In recent years, cancel culture has gained significant traction, emerging as a phenomenon where individuals or groups are ostracized and publicly shamed for their perceived transgressions. While its initial intentions may have been rooted in holding people accountable for their actions, cancel culture has morphed into a toxic force that stifles open dialogue, inhibits personal growth, and threatens the very fabric of a healthy and inclusive **society**.

So I decided to do this project as a protest force against this movement.
